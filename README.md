# GoTH GraphQL

This acts like middleware between all backend services & frontend.

Everything will serve through GraphQL which might be better for all since `GraphQL-yoga` suppors `subscriptions` out-of-the-box.

Available banckends:

* Trip Planner / OTP (work in progress)
* Geocoding / Pelias (plan)


## Procedure

    npm install
    npm start
